    "content": "Bangladesh Bangladesh (Bengali: বাংলাদেশ, Bangladesh), officially the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia, located on the northern coast of the Bay of Bengal. It shares land borders with India to the west, north, and east, and Myanmar (Burma) to the southeast. To the south lies the Bay of Bengal. It is separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the narrow Siliguri Corridor. The capital and largest city is Dhaka, and the official language is Bengali (Bangla). --- Etymology The name Bangladesh means “Land of Bengal.” It derives from the Bengali words Bangla (Bengal) and desh (country). The term gained political significance during the 20th century, particularly after the partition of Bengal and the independence movement from Pakistan. --- History Ancient and Medieval Periods The area that is now Bangladesh has been inhabited for thousands of years. It was part of several ancient kingdoms, including the Vanga, Pundra, and Gauda regions. The area flourished under Maurya, Gupta, Pala, and Sena empires. The Pala Empire (8th–12th centuries) is particularly known for its Buddhist culture and contributions to art and education. Islamic and Mughal Rule Islam spread to Bengal from the 8th century through Arab traders and Sufi missionaries. The Delhi Sultanate established control in the 13th century, and later the Mughal Empire ruled Bengal, with Dhaka serving as a major Mughal provincial capital and a center for trade and culture. British Colonial Period In 1757, following the Battle of Plassey, Bengal came under the control of the British East India Company. It became the economic heart of British India, but colonial policies also caused devastating famines. The Partition of Bengal (1905) briefly divided the region on religious lines, and again in 1947, when British India was partitioned into India and Pakistan. Bengal was divided, with East Bengal becoming East Pakistan, a province of Pakistan. Independence and Modern Era Discrimination and economic neglect by West Pakistan led to rising tensions. The Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, following a brutal crackdown by the Pakistani military, resulted in Bangladesh’s independence on December 16, 1971, with support from India. Since independence, Bangladesh has faced challenges including political instability, poverty, and natural disasters, but has made significant progress in health, education, and economic development. --- Geography Bangladesh is a low-lying deltaic country, formed by the confluence of the Ganges (Padma), Brahmaputra (Jamuna), and Meghna rivers. It features fertile plains, vast river systems, and one of the world’s largest mangrove forests — the Sundarbans, home to the Bengal tiger. The country has a tropical monsoon climate, with hot, humid summers and cooler, dry winters. --- Politics and Government Bangladesh is a unitary parliamentary republic. The President serves as head of state, while the Prime Minister is the head of government. The Jatiya Sangsad (National Parliament) is a unicameral legislature. Major political parties include the Awami League, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), and the Jatiya Party. --- Economy Bangladesh has one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia. It is classified as a developing middle-income country. Key industries include textiles and garments, agriculture, shipbuilding, and information technology. The ready-made garment (RMG) sector is the largest contributor to export earnings. Remittances from overseas workers also play a major role in the economy. --- Demographics As of 2025, Bangladesh has a population of over 170 million, making it the eighth-most populous country in the world. The majority of the population is Bengali (98%), and Bengali is the official and most widely spoken language. Islam is the state religion, practiced by around 90% of the population, followed by Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity. --- Culture Bangladeshi culture is a rich blend of Bengali traditions, Islamic heritage, and regional customs. Traditional festivals include Pahela Baishakh (Bengali New Year), Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Adha, Durga Puja, and Independence Day. Bangladeshi cuisine is known for its rice-based dishes, fish, and spices. The country has a vibrant literary and artistic tradition, with figures like Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam as cultural icons. --- Education and Science Bangladesh has achieved high literacy growth, with free primary education and a strong emphasis on female education. Major universities include the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), and Bangladesh Agricultural University. The country is investing in digital technology, renewable energy, and space research through organizations such as Bangladesh Communication Satellite Company Limited (Bangabandhu-1). --- Environment and Challenges Bangladesh faces frequent floods, cyclones, and river erosion due to its low elevation and proximity to the Bay of Bengal. It is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change but has also become a global leader in climate adaptation strategies. --- See Also Dhaka Bangladesh Liberation War Sundarbans Economy of Bangladesh Culture of Bangladesh",
